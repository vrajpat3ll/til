# What is web?

Short for World Wide Web, is a system of inter-linked documents and resources that are connected/accessed via the internet(it is a network of computers, different from the web). It allows users to view and interact with websites and web applications through a web browser (like Chrome).

## How it works?

- Web Pages are created using languages like HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (behavior).
- These pages are stored on web servers.
- When you type a URL (like https://www.google.com) into your browser:
  - The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the web server.
  - The server responds by sending back the web page's files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
  - The browser renders these files to display the web page.

Think of it like this: Internet is the infrastructure (roads), and the web is content (cars) traveling on it.
