# Problem

> Currently, I have to manually update the Table of Contents, Topics and the links to their corresponding markdown files.

# TODO

1. Devise a system so that i just have to write the article in markdown. And just run a simple command (say `update-til` or something) and all of the changes are pushed along with the correct README.md and metadata.
    - `update-til` is partially done!
    - auto push and metadata part remains
    - command-line-tools like directories have to be taken care of. sub-sections!
