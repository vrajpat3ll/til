## Nominal features

- Features that do not have any inherent numerical value or ordinal relationship.
- Find out the number of possible values a few basic features take and make a note of it.
- Encode them with [0, 1, 2, ...] or something similar.

## Missing values features

We can do either of the three given methods to get rid of missing values:

1. Drop rows or columns that contain missing values
1. Replace by mean of the entire feature
1. Replace by mean of consecutive values
